# From Prejudice to Self-Knowledge: The Psychological Evolution of Elizabeth Bennet

## Structure Map

- Intro → Methods → Results → Discussion (≈1 paragraph each)
- Tables/Figures: ≤ 1

### Variables & Measures Map
- Variables overview: IV (initial prejudice, social cues); Mediators/Moderators (free indirect discourse, emotional arousal, family reputation); DV (self-knowledge, belief revision, moral agency); Confounders (class bias, narrative satisfaction, gender norms)

### Methods / Rhetorical Strategy
- Close reading with psychological and virtue-ethical framing
- Narrative technique analysis focusing on free indirect discourse as cognitive marker

## Argument Chain

### Claim 1: Elizabeth’s early judgments reflect cognitive biases that undermine practical wisdom [RQ1]
- Evidence: Anchoring in Darcy’s Meryton slight; confirmation via Wickham’s tale; dismissal of Jane’s charity
- Reasoning / Warrant: Patterned resistance to disconfirming evidence aligns with anchoring and fundamental attribution error
- Counterargument + Rebuttal: Her wit may signal insight rather than bias — but consistency across scenes shows system error, not outlier

### Claim 2: Free indirect discourse enables a shift from misreading to reflexive self-appraisal [RQ2]
- Evidence: Internal narration registers irritation, then shame during letter rereading; Pemberley tour blends admiration with caution
- Reasoning / Warrant: Syntax mirrors cognitive recalibration — distortion becomes visible to the self within the same narrative stream
- Counterargument + Rebuttal: Narrator’s irony may drive change, not self-reflection — but shifts occur internally, without exposition

### Claim 3: Moral growth is tested through successive crises that demand revised judgment under pressure [RQ3]
- Evidence: Lydia’s elopement forces accountability; Lady Catherine’s intrusion tests resolve without retaliation
- Reasoning / Warrant: Each event challenges reformed perception, requiring integration of emotion, duty, and evidence
- Counterargument + Rebuttal: Change may be reactive, not habitual — but cumulative restraint shows internalized standards

## Method & Evaluation

### Steps
- [RQ1] Indicators: Speed of judgment, resistance to counter-evidence | Model/Tests: Cognitive bias typology (anchoring, confirmation) | Expected Direction: Early rigidity → later openness | Robustness: Cross-scene consistency check
